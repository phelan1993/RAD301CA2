##MVC Movie Store S00126107

___

You can add, delete and view details of a movie from the homepage, 
I used the external plugin bPopup to position the ajax requests in front of the page.

___

There is a sorting filter on the movies page, one can sort by ascending/descending order by clicking on the relevant titles.

___

There is a search filter also, search in the search bar at the top of the page to refine your query.

___

Viewing the actors in a movie and their screen name is temperamental. I could not find a consistent method of
hiding the div after moving away from it. 

___

There is not so much done with the actors side. I ran into several problems that set me back - 
I could not run my program to test, turns out I had to delete my database files in App_Data to proceed.
This happened <i>quite</i> regularly thereafter.
